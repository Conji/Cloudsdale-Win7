If you're here, you're probably wondering who we are and what we're about. At Cloudsdale we strive to be a central place on the web where cool ponies like you and I can have fun, get to know each other, and meet new friends. To achieve this goal, we're providing this non-profit service where everypony can have a good time. The Crew of Cloudsdale want to be ahead of the curve, redefining how regular ponies - just like you and me - use the web in every day life. A part of this is making Cloudsdale all about interacting in real time. To this end, we've built a fast, elegant and accessible system that transcends many of the big corporate services out there. Now that you know a bit about who we are and what we want, are you ready to join the party? "/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Yours truly, Zeeraw"/></TextBlock>
